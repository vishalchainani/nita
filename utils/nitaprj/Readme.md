# NITA Project Utility (`nitaprj.sh`)

This utility script helps you create, build, and manage NITA-based network automation projects using predefined profiles.

## Features

- **Project Creation:**  
  Create a new project directory from a profile template (default: `generic`).

- **Project Build:**  
  Package your project files into a zip archive and generate an Excel summary of variables, with sensitive environment variables scrubbed.

- **Version Display:**  
  Show the script version.

## Usage

You can run the script in two ways, depending on your current directory:

### 1. From Outside the Project Directory

Call the script as `nitaprj.sh` and specify the project name as an argument:

```sh
./nitaprj.sh build <projectname>
```

### 2. From Inside the Project Directory

Call the script as `nitaprj` (the script creates a symlink with this name in each project). The script automatically detects it is running inside a project by the name it is called:

```sh
./nitaprj build
```

### Commands

- `create <projectname> [profilename]`  
  Create a new project directory using the specified profile (default: `generic`).  
  **Note:** The `create` command can only be run from outside the project directory.

- `build <projectname>`  
  Build the specified project (creates a zip archive and an xlsx file).

- `version`  
  Display the script version.

### Example

```sh
# Create a new project called myproject (from outside any project directory)
./nitaprj.sh create myproject

# Build the project from outside the project directory
./nitaprj.sh build myproject

# Or, build the project from inside the project directory
cd myproject
./nitaprj build
```

## Notes

### JTAF Ansible builds

The `jtaf-ansible` profile renders generated roles before deploying their XML with
`juniper.device.config` using `load: merge`. It does not use the legacy
`junos_commit_config` role, which assembles text `.cfg` fragments.

Runtime paths live in `build/runtime.yaml`, outside workbook-managed
`group_vars` and `host_vars`. Generated roles load this file and write separate
XML files for each device under `/var/tmp/build/<host>/xml`. Do not put runtime
defaults only in `group_vars/all.yaml`: workbook generation replaces that file.

The device username (from `ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME`, falling back to `jcluser`) and
NETCONF port (`830`) also live in
`build/runtime.yaml` so workbook updates cannot remove them. Edit that file for
your environment; these play-level values override inventory values, while
Ansible extra variables can override them per invocation.
Supply password authentication through `netconf_passwd` or the Juniper module's
`ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD` environment variable, or configure SSH key authentication.
Optional
`group_vars/env.yaml` supplies the job's environment; do not package credentials
in the project archive.

Jenkins runs `bash ./run_build.sh`, which checks Kubernetes Job completion after
streaming logs. Rendering or deployment failures now fail the build. A previous
`build` Job must have been removed (normally by its 120-second TTL) before a new
build can start; an existing Job causes an explicit error instead of reusing its
result.

Both shell entry points resolve paths relative to their own project directory.
Before rendering, `build.sh` syntax-checks the deployment playbook to catch
missing collections without deploying. Deployment uses `ansible_host`, then
`management_interface.ip`, then the inventory hostname, stripping any CIDR suffix.

The rendering playbook first imports `make_etc_hosts.yaml` to populate device
hostname resolution inside the Ansible container. Each device requires
`ansible_host` or `management_interface.ip`. The task uses Ansible's built-in
`lineinfile` module rather than the generic profile's shell/sudo helper, serializes
updates, and permits in-place writes for container-mounted `/etc/hosts`.
The container user must have write access to that file.

To validate rendering without contacting devices (but updating the container's
`/etc/hosts`), run inside the Ansible image:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i hosts build/sites.yaml
```

`bash build.sh [output-directory]` renders and then deploys configuration.

- The script will prompt to install `yaml2xls.py` if not found, which is required for generating the Excel file.
- Sensitive environment variables in `group_vars/env.yaml` are scrubbed before packaging.
- The script expects a `manifest` file in the project directory to determine which files to include in the archive.
- The script distinguishes between being run from inside or outside a project directory by checking the name it is called with (`nitaprj.sh` vs `nitaprj`).

## Directory Structure

- `profiles/` - Contains project templates (profiles).
- `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` - Ansible variable files.
- `manifest` - List of files/directories to include in the build archive.
